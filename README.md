# SurveySalud

**SurveySalud** is a platform where NGOs, health workers, and community leaders can conduct and manage maternal and child health surveys tailored to their community's needs. It helps users collect, monitor, and analyze data on antenatal care, postnatal follow-ups, child vaccinations, and nutritionâ€”all centrally managed in a single, dynamic system.
