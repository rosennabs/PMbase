# SurveySalud

**SurveySalud** is a platform where users can conduct and manage maternal and child health surveys tailored to their community's needs. It helps NGOs and health workers collect, monitor, and analyze data on antenatal care, postnatal follow-ups, child vaccinations, and nutritionâ€”all centrally managed in a single, dynamic system.
